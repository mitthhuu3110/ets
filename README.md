# Employee Tracking System (ETS)

The Employee Tracking System (ETS) is a robust RESTful web application designed for organizations to efficiently manage employee records. Built with Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and PostgreSQL, ETS supports full CRUD operations, secure access, and is ready for scalable deployment in modern cloud or on-premise environments.

## Architecture

### High-Level Overview

The ETS application follows a layered architecture, separating concerns for maintainability and scalability:

- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses ([`EmployeeController`](src/main/java/com/example/employeemanagement/controller/EmployeeController.java))
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic ([`EmployeeService`](src/main/java/com/example/employeemanagement/service/EmployeeService.java))
- **Repository Layer**: Data access using Spring Data JPA ([`EmployeeRepository`](src/main/java/com/example/employeemanagement/repository/EmployeeRepository.java))
- **Model Layer**: Entity definitions ([`Employee`](src/main/java/com/example/employeemanagement/model/Employee.java))

### Recommended Deployment Plan

- **Backend**: Spring Boot application running in a Docker container
- **Database**: PostgreSQL in a separate Docker container or managed cloud service
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins pipeline for build, test, Docker image creation, and deployment ([Jenkinsfile](Jenkinsfile))
- **Reverse Proxy (optional)**: Nginx or similar for SSL termination and routing
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana (optional, for production)

## Database Schema

### PostgreSQL Table: `employees`

| Column      | Type         | Constraints           | Description           |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| id          | BIGSERIAL    | PRIMARY KEY          | Employee ID           |
| name        | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL             | Employee Name         |
| email       | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL, UNIQUE     | Employee Email        |
| department  | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL             | Department Name       |

#### SQL DDL

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    department VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```
